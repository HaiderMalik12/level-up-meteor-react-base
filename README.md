## What is this?

A base for starting Meteor projects using React as a front-end framework instead of Blaze.

## What is in it?

In time, you will know. Well.. I just haven't completed this section of the readme yet, but in the meantime you can paw over the packages file in the .meteor dir to get a good idea what this comes with.
